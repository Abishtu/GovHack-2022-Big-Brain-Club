# GovHack 2022
* **Team: The Big Brain Club**
* **Project: Microfarming at scale**

Exploring the feasibility of creating a microfarming economy. Whether through community-based farms or privately owned farms, is there room to take the strain off the food supply in our increasingly growing population. Further, the option to reduce the reliance on imports for food will increase self-sufficiency for Australia. Transport emissions both international and domestic would be reduced due to the proximity of local farms and the centralised distribution centres.

## App
As part of the solution we're including an app that can be used by members of the community to interact with their community farms, they can use the app to 
  * Check for availability of grown produce and transplants.
  * Find opertutnities to volunteer at the farm (minimum of 1 hour)
  * Have access to a daily overview of the farm, this includes information like
    * Stock availability of produce and transplants
    * News and updates on the farm an how its engaging with the community.
