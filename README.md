* **Project: Microfarming at scale**

Exploring the feasibility of creating a microfarming economy. Whether through community-based farms or privately owned farms, is there room to take the strain off the food supply in our increasingly growing population. Further, the option to reduce the reliance on imports for food will increase self-sufficiency for Australia. Transport emissions both international and domestic would be reduced due to the proximity of local farms and the centralised distribution centres.
